Just doing more tests, if you read this, you're weird, but incredibly dedicated to information, so I commend you.

This is a damn mash of things I'm experimenting with. The pluck part comes from Romain's talk at  Faust Physical Moddelling workshop in 2020. The pixi.js stuff is handling the pipeline to use webGL shaders. The Freq shift in the dsp file is taken from Ollie Larkin's OWL patches, and the delay is I think the saem fractional delay Romain talks about in the Kadenze course. 

I plan to make a midi controlled version of this patch (have already made it actually, just need to make a page for it)

Down the line I'm gonna be exploring sync'ing audio files playback and exploring active user engagement in the listening experience. 

I wouldn't treat any of the stuff in my github account as finished, at least I wouldn't use it if you don't understand it, as I barely understand any of this shit. 

If anything's useful hack away. 

All of thyis is made possible by the awesome people reseaching music technology at GRAME in france, the creators and maintainers of Faust programming language.
